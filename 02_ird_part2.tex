\section{Swaptions}
\begin{frame}{Swaptions Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> The purchaser of an \textcolor{red}{European swaption} has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract, at a given future time, called the \textcolor{red}{swaption maturity}.
	\item<2-> There are two types of \textcolor{red}{swaptions} (as the underlying swaps): a \emph{payer} in which at maturity the buyer could become the fixed-rate payer and a \emph{receiver} where she could become the fixed-rate receiver.
	\item <3-> The strike price of the swaption determines the fixed rate of the underlying swap.
	\item<4-> A swaption provides protection for a borrower as it ensures a maximum fixed interest rate payable in the future. Furthermore, it gives her the flexibility, if the rate does not rise above the swaption strike rate at expiry, to choose not to exercise it and take advantage of the lower market rates.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaptions Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Usually, the swaption maturity coincides with the first reset date of the underlying IRS (the Interest Rate Swap length is called the \textcolor{red}{tenor} of the swaption).	
	\item<2-> If you are on the buyer side (you are long payer swaption) which is your view on rates ? Why ?
	\item<3-> Are there any risks associated with a Swaption?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<4-> The primary risk with a Swaption occurs after you have exercised your right and proceeded with the Swap. Should interest rate movements be different to your expectations, the Swap may have the opposite effect to what you were trying to achieve with the transaction. 
		\item<5-> If interest rates do not rise above the strike on the exercise date, you have not obtained any benefit from the premium paid for the purchase of the Swaption. The premium is the cost of obtaining protection against a rise in interest rates.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Payoff}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> The discounted payoff of a payer Swaption (with maturity $T_\alpha$) is given, recalling the value of a payer IRS (\cref{eq:swap_as_sum_fra}) by
	\begin{equation}
		\textbf{PSw}=D(t,T_\alpha)\left(\sum_{i=\alpha+1}^\beta P(T_\alpha,T_i)\tau_i (F(T_\alpha;T_{i-1},T_i) - K)\right)^+
		\label{eq:swaption_payoff_std}
	\end{equation}
	\item<2-> Unfortunately this payoff \textcolor{red}{cannot} be easily decomposed into elementary parts (as done for Cap/Floor). Indeed the \emph{positive part operator} $(\cdot)^+$ is "outside" the summation (while for Caps it is "inside").
	\item<3-> Nevertheless it can be simplified by writing it in a different way...
	%		\begin{equation}
		%			ND(t,T_\alpha)\left(S_{\alpha,\beta}(T_\alpha)-K\right)^+\sum_{i=\alpha+1}^\beta \tau_i P(t,T_i)
		%		\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Payoff}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Recall that we have expressed the swap payoff also as (\cref{eq:swap_payoff_with_swap_rate})
	\begin{equation*}
	\textbf{PFS}=\sum_{i=\alpha+1}^\beta \tau_i P(t,T_i)(S_{\alpha,\beta}-K) = A(S_{\alpha,\beta}-K)
	\end{equation*}
	\item<2-> If we look at the swaption payoff through this expression modeling as stochastic variable directly $S_{\alpha,\beta}(t)$, instead of each forward rate $F(t;T_{i-1},T_i)$, we can write the swaption price as the expectation of
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{\textbf{PSw}=\expect{Q}\left[D(t,T_\alpha)A\max(S_{\alpha,\beta}(T_\alpha)-K, 0)\right]}
	\end{equation}
	which looks like easier and more intuitive than previous \cref{eq:swaption_payoff_std}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Characterization}
	\begin{itemize}	
		\item We characterize the payoff in three different ways
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The swaption is said to be \textcolor{red}{at-the-money} (ATM) if
			\begin{equation*}
				K = K_{ATM} = S_{\alpha,\beta}(0) = \frac{P(0,T_\alpha)-P(0,T_\beta)}{\sum_{i=\alpha+1}^\beta \tau_i P(0,T_i)}
			\end{equation*}
			where $T_\alpha$ is the maturity of the swaption, and $T_\beta$ the last payment date of the underlying swap (the first being $T_{\alpha+1})$. That is when the strike is equal to the swap forward rate $S_{\alpha,\beta}$.
			\item The payer swaption is \textcolor{red}{in-the-money} if $K<K_{ATM}$ and \textcolor{red}{out-of-the-money} otherwise.
			\item The opposite holds for the receiver swaption.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item ATM swaptions are quoted for maturities ranging between $1m$ and $30y$, and for tenors between $1y$ and $30y$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Swaption as an Option on a Swap}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item So the forward rates are the chosen state variable, also the correlation between them is needed...
%		\item Market practice: approximation formula (see chapter 6 of Brigo-Mercurio) the definitive reference for this issue.
%		\item Clearly here a model which accounts for terminal correlations needed.
%		\item Which is the relationship between a Cap and a payer swaption with the same payment and roll dates ?
%	\end{itemize}
%
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{An Example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{A} has raised a $10y$ loan with floating interest rates fixed every three months (IBOR + margin).
		\item \textbf{A} wants to \emph{hedge the loan against rising interest rates but also to benefit from the floating rate}, i.e. should interest rates not rise above a certain level (the swaptions strike-rate $K$).
		\item The purchase of a payer swaption could hedge this risk: 
		\begin{columns}
			\column{0.45\linewidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{interest rates increase}: \textbf{A} may exercise the swaption and be a party of a swap as a payer of a fixed interest rate;
				\item \textbf{swap-rate below $K$}: it will not be exercised and \textbf{A} will continue to have floating-rate funding.

\begin{frame}{Black Formula for Swaptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The most common way to price European Swaption is through the Black formula.
	\item Replacing the forward rate $F(0;t_{i-1},t_i)$ with the swap rate $S_{\alpha,\beta}(0)$ and plugging in the quoted swaption volatility you get Black's formula for swaptions
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{\begin{aligned}
			\textbf{PSw}_{Bl}(0,T,&N,K,S_{\alpha,\beta})=\\
			&N\left[S_{\alpha,\beta}(0)\Phi(d_1)-K\Phi(d_2)\right]\sum_{i=\alpha+1}^\beta P(0,T_i)\tau_i
		\end{aligned}}
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{gathered}
		d_{1,2} = \cfrac{\log{\frac{S_{\alpha,\beta}}{K}} \pm \frac{v^2}{2}}{2}\\[0.2cm] 
		v = \sigma_{\alpha,\beta}\sqrt{T_\alpha}
		\end{gathered}
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Swaptions Volatility Calibration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Swaption volatilities are quoted for different maturities and tenors (length of the underlying swap).
	\item Both for ATM and away from ATM on both sides ("swaption smile").
	\item So swaptions have an additional dimension with respect to caps: the quotes are parametrized according to 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item maturites;
		\item tenors;
		\item strikes.
	\end{itemize}
	%\item They have also a different \emph{delta} effect on your book.
	%		\item Volatility trade between caps ans swaption: WEDGE
\end{itemize}

  After we have constructed the volatility matrix we can fit the ``smile'' at each (expiry, tenor) pair.

  This is done assuming the volatilities evolves according to the SABR model. An approximated solution has been given by \emph{Hagan et al.}
  \begin{eqnarray} \sigma _{B}(K,f) &=&\frac{\textcolor{red}{\alpha} \left\{ 1+\left[ \frac{\left( 1-\textcolor{red}{\beta} \right) ^{2}}{24}\frac{\textcolor{red}{\alpha} ^{2}}{(fK)^{1-\textcolor{red}{\beta}}}+\frac{1}{4}\frac{\textcolor{red}{\rho \beta \nu\alpha}}{(fK)^{(1-\textcolor{red}{\beta})/2}}+\frac{2-3\textcolor{red}{\rho} ^{2}}{24}\textcolor{red}{\nu}^{2}\right] T\right\} }{(fK)^{(1-\textcolor{red}{\beta})/2}\left[ 1+\frac{(1-\textcolor{red}{\beta})^{2}}{24}\ln ^{2} \frac{f}{K}+\frac{(1-\textcolor{red}{\beta})^{4}}{1920}\ln^{4}\frac{f}{K}\right] } \times \frac{z}{\chi (z)} \notag \\ z &=&\frac{\textcolor{red}{\nu}}{\textcolor{red}{\alpha}}(fK)^{(1-\textcolor{red}{\beta})/2}\ln \frac{f}{K} \notag \\ \chi (z) &=&\ln \left[ \frac{\sqrt{1-2\rho z+z^{2}}+z-\textcolor{red}{\rho}}{1-\textcolor{red}{\rho}}\right] . \notag \end{eqnarray}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Newton-Raphson Method}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The roots of the function (or zeros) are the $x_i$ solutions of $f(x) = 0$.
    \item \emph{Newton's method} is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations of the roots.
    \item Start with an initial guess $x_0$, approximate the function by its tangent line $g(x)$, and compute the $x$-intercept of this line
    \begin{gather*}
g(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) \implies  f'(x_0)(x_0-x_1)=f(x_0)\\
	x_1=x_0-\frac {f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
\end{gather*}
    %\item This $x$-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the original function's root than the first guess, and the method can be iterated.
    \item If the tangent line to the curve $f(x)$ at $x = x_0$ intercepts the $x$-axis at $x_{1}$ then
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
f(x_1) < \text{tol}=10^{-8} \Rightarrow \text{ zero found !}\\
g(x_1) = f(x_0) + f^{'}(x_0)(x_1-x_0) = 0 \Rightarrow \text{ solve for
}x_1\text{ and iterate...}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\item The method will usually converge, provided this initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero, and that $f'(x_0) \neq 0$.

%\begin{frame}{Differences between Caps and Swaptions}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item<1-> Caps can be decomposed into more elementary products: \textcolor{red}{caplets}. Value each caplet one by one and then add their prices
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item each forward rate can be modeled as a random variable;
%		\item \textbf{no joint action of forward LIBOR rates is involved.}
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item<2-> Unfortunately this is not possible with swaptions. The swap rate is \textcolor{red}{essentially a weighted average of forward rates} $S=\frac{\sum F(t;T_{i-1},T_i)}{\sum P(t,T_i)}$, hence its volatility should depend on each forward rate volatilities \textbf{as well as} their correlations.
%	\item<3-> If you take as "fundamental" entity the LIBOR rates you have to deal with the joint action of the simple forward LIBOR rates and so with the \textbf{terminal correlation} between rates of different portions of the yield curve. 
%	\item<4-> This issue will be extensively studied in the context of the Libor Market Models further on down the course.
%	%Can you provide an example ?

\subsection{Bond Options}
\begin{frame}{An Option to Exchange Fixed with Float}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> We have seen that a Swap can be viewed as an exchange of bonds (fixed for float).
	\item<2-> Hence a Swaption can be regarded as an \textcolor{red}{option to exchange fixed for floating} bonds (or vice versa).
	\item<3-> In case it would be possible to get a simple expression for a \textcolor{red}{Coupon Bond Option} we could use to price Swaptions.
	\item <4-> It would be even simpler if we could express a Coupon Bond Option as a portfolio of Zero Coupon Bond Options.
	\item<5-> Luckily we can do that thanks to a recipe known as \textcolor{red}{Jamshidian's decomposition}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Jamshidian's Decomposition}
\begin{block}{Theorem}
	Consider a sequence of functions $f_i$, a random variable $W$ and a constant $K\ge0$. If each $f_i$ is monotone (decreasing), that is $\cfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial W} < 0;\;\forall i$, then 
	\begin{equation*}
		\left(K - \sum_i f_i(W)\right)^+ = 	\sum_i \left(K_i - f_i(W)\right)^+
	\end{equation*} 
	In financial terms it means that the payoff of an option on a portfolio of assets can be expressed in terms of a portfolio of options on each asset.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Jamshidian's Decomposition Proof}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Since each $f_i$ is monotone also $\sum_i f_i$ is decreasing. Hence there is a unique solution $\hat{w}$ to 
	\begin{equation*}
		\sum_i f_i(\hat{w}) = K   
	\end{equation*}
	\item<2-> Each $f_i$ is decreasing so
	\begin{columns}
	\column{0.7\linewidth}
	\uncover<2->{\begin{equation*}
	\left(K - \sum_i f_i(W)\right)^+ = \left(\sum_i f_i(\hat{w}) -  \sum_i f_i(W)\right)^+ =

	\uncover<3->{\begin{equation*}
	= \left(\sum_i (f_i(\hat{w}) -  f_i(W))\right)^+= \sum_i (f_i(\hat{w}) - f_i(W))\mathbbm{1}_{W\ge \hat{w}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Consider a coupon bond which pays the following cash flows $\mathcal{C}=\{c_1,\dots,c_n\}$ at dates $\mathcal{T}=\{T_1,\ldots,T_n\}$.
	\item<2-> Let $t\leq T_1$, the bond price is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\textbf{CB}(t,\mathcal{C},\mathcal{T})=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \Pi(t, T_i, r(t))
	\end{equation*}
	\item<3-> Suppose we would like to calculate the price of a put option with strike $K$ on this coupon bond. The payoff reads
	\begin{equation*}
		\textbf{CBP}=\left[K-\textbf{CB}(t,\mathcal{C},\mathcal{T})\right]^+ = \left[K-\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \Pi(t, T_i, r(t))\right]^+
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coupon Bond Option}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Now apply the Jamshidian's decomposition to previous payoff.
	\item<2-> First need to find the interest rate value $r^*$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \Pi(t, T_i, r^*) = K$.
	\item<3-> Assuming the interest rate model satisfies the required condition (which is true for Short Rate models for example)
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{\partial \Pi(t,T_i,r(t))}{\partial r}<0,\;\forall 0<t<s
	\end{equation*}
	we can write the payoff as
	\begin{equation}
		\textbf{CBP}(t,T_i,\Pi,r^*) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i [\Pi(t, T_i, r^*)-\Pi(t, T_i, r(t))]^+
	\label{eq:bond_option_payoff}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coupon Bond Option}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cref{eq:bond_option_payoff} tells us that we can price a coupon bond option as a portfolio of options on ZCBs.
	\item The strike of these option is calculated as the value of a ZCB given a \emph{particular} value of the short rate, determined with a root finding procedure.
	\item In formulas the CBO with maturity $T$ and strike $K$ reads
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{\textbf{CBP}(t,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{C},K) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \textbf{ZBP}(t,T_i,\Pi,r^*)}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Pricing under Affine Models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When interest rates are modeled using \textcolor{red}{Affine Short Rate Models} (Vasicek, Hull-White,\ldots) swpation pricing can be performed semi-analytically.
	\item \cref{eq:swaption_payoff_std} can be rewritten, expressing the underlying swap in terms of bonds, as
\begin{equation*}
\textbf{PSw}=NP(t_0, T_\alpha)\mathbb{E}_t\left[\max\left(1-\sum_{k=\alpha+1}^\beta c_kP(T_\alpha,T_k), 0\right)\right]
\end{equation*}
with $c_k=K\tau_k$ for $k=\alpha+1,\ldots,\beta-1$ and $c_\beta=(1+K\tau_\beta)$.
	\item One of the most striking properties of \emph{Affine Models} is that they relate ZCB price to a spot rate modeled according to 
	\begin{equation*}
		P(t,T) = A_r(t,T)e^{-B_r(t,T)r}
	\end{equation*} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Pricing under Affine Models}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hence
\begin{equation*}
\textbf{PSw}=NP(t_0, T_\alpha)\mathbb{E}_t\left[\max\left(1-\sum_{k=\alpha+1}^\beta c_k A_r(\tau_k)e^{B_r(\tau_k)r(T_\alpha)}, 0\right)\right]
\end{equation*}
	\item Using the Jamshidian decomposition the $\max$ operator can be swapped with the sum
\begin{equation*}
\textbf{PSw}=NP(t_0, T_\alpha)\sum_{k=\alpha+1}^\beta c_k \mathbb{E}_t\left[\max\left(\bar{K_k} - A_r(\tau_k)e^{B_r(\tau_k)r(T_\alpha)}, 0\right)\right]
\end{equation*}
whit $\bar{K_k} := A_r(\tau_k)e^{B_r(\tau_k)r^{*}}$, where the parameter $r^{*}$ is determined by solving
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=\alpha+1}^\beta c_k \left(A_r(\tau_k)e^{B_r(\tau_k)r^{*}}\right) = 1
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Swaption Pricing under Affine Models}
\begin{itemize}
\item As noted above for the bond options, each element of the sum in the formula above represents a European put option on a zero-coupon bond, which in the \emph{affine models} has a closed-form solution.
\item So a payer swaption price is thus given by
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{\textbf{PSw}(t,T,N) = N\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \textbf{ZBP}(t,T_k,K_k)}
	\end{equation}
	while the receiver swaption price reads
	\begin{equation}
		\boxed{\textbf{RSw}(t,T,N) = N\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \textbf{ZBC}(t,T_k,K_k)}
	\end{equation}

\subsection{Bermudan Swaption}
\begin{frame}{Bermudan Swaptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> It is a swaption in which the optionality can be exercised at a \textcolor{red}{predetermined set of dates} (not only one).
	\item<2-> It is useful for hedging callable bonds (especially if step-up, i.e. with the coupon increasing with time).
	\item<3-> A \textcolor{red}{Bermudan Swaption} gives the holder the right but not the obligation to enter in an interest rate swap contract at different dates (usually the swap reset dates) with some days of notification to the counter-party.
	\item<4-> The interest rate swap the holder can enter into, is the same existing contract, so if the holder does not exercise at the first date in the call schedule, the option for the following periods is just written on shorter swaps.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bermudan Swaption Example}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> As an example consider the following: receiver Bermudan Swaption written on a 3 years swap with the first call date $2y$ from now (we suppose semi-annual payments).
	\item<2-> If at the end of the second year she will not exercise, six months later she will have to decide if entering or not in the same remaining swap which now has become a $2y6m$ swap.
	\item<3-> If again she will not exercise the last possibility will involve the decision of whether or not to enter on the $2y6m-3y$~$FRA$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}		

%\begin{frame}{Bermudan Swaption Payoff}

%	\item At the maturity $T$, the payoff of a Bermudan swaption is given by
%	\begin{equation*}
%%		\textbf{BS}(T) = \max(0, V_{\text{swap}}(T))
%%	\end{equation*}
%%	where $V_{swap}(T)$ is the value of the underlying swap in $T$.

%%	\begin{equation*}
%%	\textbf{BS}(T_i) = \max(K(T_i), V_{\text{swap}}(T_i))
%%	\end{equation*}
%%	where $V_{\text{swap}}(T_i)$ is the exercise value of the swap and $K(T_i)$ is the intrinsic value, i.e. the holder of the option receives $\max(K(T_i), 0)$ if the option is exercised at time $T_i$.

\begin{frame}{Bermudan Swaption Pricing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Some interest rate instruments can be priced just looking at the term structure of interest rates (FRA and Swaps)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the only problem is: which is the right term structure ? (this is a lesson from the 2008 crisis).
	\end{itemize}
	\item<2-> Some other instruments cannot be priced only with the yield curve: we need the future (risk-neutral) evolution of the rates.
	%\item Non-linearities come in !
	%\item Swaptions are non-linear products and may require to model the correlation between forward LIBOR rates.
	\item<3-> Given the complexity of Bermudan swaption valuation (which belongs to the latter class), there is no closed form solution.		
	\item<4-> Typically tree techniques or the Longstaff-Schwartz method are used.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a Bermudan put option with strike $K$ and $n$-years maturity. Each year you can choose whether to exercise or not.
    %Let's implement a MC which actually simulates, besides the evolution of the market, what an investor holding this option would do.
    \item The evolution of the asset value and of the money market account gives
    \begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
		S(t_1=1y) = S(t_0)e^{(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)(t_1-t_0)+\sigma\sqrt{t_1-t_0}\mathcal{N}(0,1)} \\
		B(t_1=1y)=B(t_0)e^{r(t_1-t_0)}
	\end{gathered}
    \end{equation}
    \item \emph{At this point how does the investor know if it is convenient to exercise?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exercise:} in this case we knows exactly the payoff;
        \item \textbf{No Exercise:} the contract has become a European Put Option with shorter maturity.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The decision will depend on each choice convenience:
    \begin{equation*}
\max[K-S(t_1), P(t_1,T;S(t_1),K)]
    \end{equation*}
where $P(t_1,T;S(t_1),K)$ is the price of a Put which can be computed analytically (i.e. the \emph{continuation value}, the value of holding the option instead of early exercising it).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item So the premium of the option is the average of this discounted payoffs calculated in each Monte Carlo simulation
\begin{equation*}
	\cfrac{1}{N}\sum_i\max[K-S(t_1), P(t_1,T;S(t_1),K)]
\end{equation*}
    \item In this case we could price this product because we have an analytical pricing formula for the Put, but what if we didn't ?
    \item \textbf{Brute force solution:} for each realization of $S(t_i)$ we run another Monte Carlo to price the alternative continuation value.
    \item We need to implement nested MC which is usually a very bad idea. Its execution time grows as $N^2$, which becomes prohibitive when you deal with multiple exercise dates !
\end{itemize}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm}
Let's search for a smarter solution analyzing the relationship between the continuation value and the realizations of $S$ at step $t_1$.
%We can plot the discounted payoff at maturity, $P_i$ vs $S_i(t_1)$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item So we have found an \emph{empirical pricing formula} for the unknown contract to be used in the Monte Carlo Simulation
\begin{equation}
	P(t_i,T,S(t_i),K)=c_0+c_1 S(t_i) + c_2 S(t_i)^2 + c_3 S(t_i)^3 + c_4 S(t_i)^4 + c_5 S(t_i)^5
\end{equation}
    The formula is obviously fast, the cost of the algorithm being just the best fit. 
    \item Clearly we could have used any form for the curve (not only a polynomial), but small improvement does not justify the increased complexity.

\subsection{Callable Bonds}
\begin{frame}{Callable Coupon Bond}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> A \textcolor{red}{callable bond} is a bond in which, on the call date(s) (there can be more than one), the \textbf{issuer} has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back (redeem) the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price.
	\item<2-> We have seen that a swap can be regarded as an exchange of bonds. It is easy to guess that a replica for the callable bond price can be obtained by simply adding a (swap-)option to the swap used to price the underlying bond.
	\item<3-> If there are multiple callability dates is clear that the swaption we need is a Bermudan one.
	\item<4-> With a receiver bermudan swaption with the same contractual conventions of the bond (i.e. the strike of the swaption is equal to the coupon of the bond) we can offset it. %; which represents the economic equivalent of calling the bond at par.
	%\item So $\max(CCBP(T,S,K,\tau)-100, 0)$ can be represented as $\max(K-S(T_j,\beta)(T), 0)$.
	%\item Intuition: long on the bond, short on the rates.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Callable vs Non Callable Coupon Bonds}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> \emph{Ceteris paribus} a non callable coupon bond has an higher price than a callable one because the callability option adds value to the issuer
	\begin{equation*}
		\text{price of callable bond} = \text{price of straight bond} – \text{price of call option}.
	\end{equation*}
	\item<2-> If interest rates decline, the issuer of a callable bond can issue new debt, receiving a lower interest rate than the original callable bond, and use the the proceeds from this second issue to pay off the earlier callable bond by exercising the call feature.
	\item<3-> As a result, \textcolor{red}{the company has refinanced its debt by paying off the higher-yielding callable bonds with the newly-issued debt at a lower interest rate}.		
%	\item At inception both must be worth 100 (apart from other costs and fees which we will neglect).
%	\item A typical coupon bond, once credit risk is isolated and remunerated, will pay the average market rates prevailing at the time of the issue. These are related to the swap rate prevailing at that moment (remember that the swap rate is sort of average of forward rates).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Callable vs Non Callable Coupon Bonds}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Suppose credit risk is zero: in this ideal case the coupon bond will pay the corresponding swap rate prevailing on the market.
%	If we price a $5y$ bond, at inception, the following must hold
%	\begin{equation*}
%		CBP(0,5,K,\tau)=100-NPV_{\text5y-swap(0)}=100
%	\end{equation*}
%	\item Which implies $NPV_{\text{5y-swap(0)}}=0$, hence $K=S_{\text{5y-swap(0)}}$. This means that credit consideration apart, a bank must pay the market prevailing rate when it issues a bond. %And this should not surprise anyone.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Callable vs Non Callable Coupon Bonds}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Consider now the same bond with a callability option after two years each six months.
%	\item Let us denote with $RBS(t,6m,T_{1c},T_\beta,K,N)$ the Bermudan receiver swaption with first call date $T_{1c}$ and subsequent ones every six months. The last payment date is equal to the swap maturity.
%	\item In this case the call dates vector is $[2y,2y6m,3y,3y6m,4y,4y6m]$.
%	\item Suppose $RBS(0,6m,T_{2y},T_{5y},K_1,N)>0$
%	\begin{equation*}
%		CBP(0,5,K,\tau)=100-(NPV_{\text{5y-swap(0)}}+NPV_{RBS})=100
%	\end{equation*}
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Risk Analysis of Callable Bonds}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A callable bond benefits the issuer, and so investors of these bonds are compensated with a more attractive interest rate than on otherwise similar non-callable bonds.
		%\item Paying down debt early by exercising callable bonds saves a company interest expense and prevents the company from being put in financial difficulties in the long term if economic or financial conditions worsen. 
		\item<1-> The investor might not make out as well as the company when the bond is called. Not only she loses the remaining interest payments but unlikely she will be able to match the original coupon.
		\textcolor{red}{This situation is known as reinvestment risk}. 

		%For example, let's say a 6\% coupon bond is issued and is due to mature in five years. An investor purchases 10000 worth and receives coupon payments of 6\% x 10,000 or 600 annually. Three years after issuance, the interest rates fall to 4\%, and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder must turn in the bond to get back the principal, and no further interest is paid.
		%In this scenario, not only does the bondholder lose the remaining interest payments but it would be unlikely they will be able to match the original 6\% coupon. 
		\item<2-> As a result, a callable bond may not be appropriate for investors seeking stable income and predictable returns.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Break-even Rate}
\begin{itemize}
\item In general, we can assume that \textbf{it is optimal for the issuer to minimize the value of the contract}.
\item She will exercise the option \emph{if the price of the callable bond exceeds the exercise price ($X$) at the notice date ($t_n$)}. 
\item Otherwise, she will give up the option right and the callable bond price will be equal to that of the non-option bond.
\item Denote by $r_b$ the \emph{break-even interest rate} which represents the rate value such that the issuer is indifferent between exercising the option or not.
\begin{equation}
X\cdot D(t_n, t_c) - P(r,t_n)=0    
\end{equation}
where $D(t_n, t_c)$ is the discount factor between notice and exercise dates ($t_c$) and $P(r,t_n)$ the price of the callable bond an instant before the notice date.
\end{itemize}
%We know the value of the callable bond $P(r,t_n)$ since it is equal to the value of the non-option bond. The solution of equation is the cross point between the two curves.

%\begin{frame}{Risk Analysis of Callable Bonds}
%	\begin{itemize}
%
%		Callable bonds typically pay a higher coupon or interest rate to investors than non-callable bonds. The companies that issue these products benefit as well. Should the market interest rate fall lower than the rate being paid to the bondholders, the business may call the note. They may then, refinance the debt at a lower interest rate. This flexibility is usually more favorable for the business than using bank-based lending. 
%		
%		However, not every aspect of a callable bond is favorable. An issuer will usually call the bond when interest rates fall. This calling leaves the investor exposed to replacing the investment at a rate that will not return the same level of income. Conversely, when market rates rise, the investor can fall behind when their funds are tied up in a product that pays a lower rate. Finally, companies must offer a higher coupon to attract investors. This higher coupon will increase the overall cost of taking on new projects or expansions.

%	??????????????
%	\item Coupons are better than market prevailing rates would have allowed for a fixed rate note.
%	\item After the bond issue if rates go down the bank will call the bond (because, ceteris paribus, it will have a price above 100) as it will not want to pay an higher than market level remuneration for the money it has borrowed from customers,i.e. this is like writing (selling) an option, the option writer gets a premium up front, but has a downside if the option is exercised.
%	\item Conversely if rates go up it will not buy back the bond as in financing itself at a lower than market implied rates.
%	%The call price will usually exceed the par or issue price. In certain cases, mainly in the high-yield debt market, there can be a substantial call premium.
%	%The largest market for callable bonds is that of issues from government sponsored entities. They own many mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S., mortgages are usually fixed rate, and can be prepaid early without cost, in contrast to the norms in other countries. If rates go down, many home owners will refinance at a lower rate. As a consequence, the agencies lose assets. By issuing numerous callable bonds, they have a natural hedge, as they can then call their own issues and refinance at a lower rate.
%	%\item It cannot go much above par. The price-yield relation is broken at a certain level.
%	%\item Investors sells an option to the bank for higher (initial) coupons.
%	%\item Customer is long bond, short rates, short option (receiver swaption).

\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Denote with $F(T)$ the short-term rate observed in $T$. We can write the \textcolor{red}{Reverse Floater} coupon in general form as
	\begin{equation*}
		\textbf{RF}=\max[0, K-\alpha F(T)] = \underbrace{K-\alpha F(T) + \max[\alpha F(T)-K,0]}_{rule 2}
	\end{equation*}
	\item<2-> Previous equation gives the payoff as the sum of a fixed leg of an IRS and a Cap with strike $K$
\begin{equation}
	\boxed{\textbf{RF} = \underbrace{K - \alpha F(T)}_{\text{IRS fixed leg}} + \underbrace{\max[\alpha F(T)-K,0]}_{\text{Cap}}}
\end{equation}

%	\item Which, adding and subtracting $K$ (\emph{rule 1}), and by \emph{rule 5} can be rewritten as
%	\begin{equation*}
%		\begin{aligned}
%		\textbf{RF}&=\max[0, K-\alpha F(T)]=\max[-K,-\alpha F(T)] + K = \\
%		&= K - \min[K,\alpha F(T)]
%		\end{aligned}
%	\end{equation*}
%	\item Finally \emph{rule 5}, then \emph{rule 1} twice (once with $K$ and another with $\alpha F(T)$) after having added and subtracted $\alpha F(T)$
%	\begin{equation}
%		\begin{aligned}
%			\textbf{RF} &= K - \min[K,\alpha F(T)] = \overbrace{K + \max[-K, -\alpha F(T)]}^{rule 1}\\
%			&=\underbrace{\max[0, K-\alpha F(T)]}_{rule 5} = \underbrace{K - \alpha F(T) + \max[\alpha F(T)-K,0]}_{rule 2}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> One can also buy a reverse floater if the rates are low now and believes they stay low, even though the forward contracts are implying an increase. If rates do not change, by holding the reverse floater outperform floating rate notes on the same index.
	\item<3-> Third if an investor has invested in bonds, and if interest rate falls, she will receive lower returns than expected. In this scenario, inverse floaters in the portfolio provide higher returns.

\begin{frame}{Reverse Floater Bond}
	\begin{itemize}
%		\item As with all leveraged investments, inverse floaters introduce significant interest rate risk. 
		\item Other typical investors are \textbf{long vega}: if $K$ is close to the forward rates, vega is much higher (do you know why ?).
		\item Such a position means you have a \emph{positive vega exposure}, i.e. take profit from an increase in volatility: 
		a long call/put option can be used. 
		\item A \emph{short vega} position instead means you have a negative vega exposure (profit from a decrease in volatility). \item A short call/put option can be used to create a short vega position. 
		\item High volatility can result in drastic market swings. It typically has a negative correlation to the market, i.e. spiked volatility can be result into downward market velocity.

Should implied volatility increase, there will be an increase in the option's premium. Inversely, if there is a decrease in implied volatility, there will be a decrease in the option's premium. 
%	\item Vega changes when there are larger price swings (higher implied volatility) which can be equated to higher uncertainty. Lower implied volatility can be connected to lower uncertainty, which equates to less dramatic swings of the underlying security.
