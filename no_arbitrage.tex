\section{Random Variables}
\begin{frame}{Random Variables}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
	A variable whose value is a number determined by the outcome of a random experiment is called a \textcolor{red}{random variable}.
	\end{block}
	\vspace{0.5 cm}
        
	\pause
	Random variables are very different from usual \emph{algebraic variables}:
\begin{equation*}
	x^2 - 3 = 0 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{3}
\end{equation*}	
	$x$ stays the same no matter how many times I solve this equation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Random Variables}
	A random variable instead is kind of a mapping between 
	\begin{equation*}
		X(\omega):\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\quad \forall\omega\in\Omega
	\end{equation*}
	such that $X(\omega)$ represents the occurrence probability of the "outcome" $\omega$. $\Omega$ is called \textcolor{red}{sample space} and is the set of all possible future states (or outcomes) of the random process.
	\pause
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        
	Hence the random variable $X$ will take values distributed according to the probability distribution of the random process, e.g. if $X$ represents the outcomes of rolling a \emph{fair} die $\Omega = [1,2,3,4,5,6]$ and each value has equal probability of 1/6.
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        
	\textcolor{red}{A random variable is always associated to a probability distribution.}
%	There are two kinds of random variable:
%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\item Discrete Random Variable
	%		\item Continuous Random Variable
	%	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Properties and Characteristics of Random Variables}
\begin{frame}{Discrete and Continuous Random Variables}
	\begin{block}{Definition} 
		If a random variable takes only a countable number (finite) of values, it is called \textcolor{red}{discrete}.
	\end{block}
	
	\small{
		\textbf{Example:} when 3 coins are tossed, the number of heads obtained is the random variable, which assumes the values $\Omega=\{0,1,2,3\}$ ($\Omega$ ia a countable set).}
	\newline
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Definition} 
		A random variable $X$ which can take any value between a certain interval is called \textcolor{red}{continuous}.
	\end{block}
	
	\small{\textbf{Example:} the height of students in a particular class lies between 160 and 190~cm $(X = \{x|160 \leq x \leq 190\})$.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability Distribution}
	Let $X$ be a random variable defined on a domain $\Omega$ of possible outcomes. 
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
	\begin{table}[bt]
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
			\textbf{Discrete} & \textbf{Continuous} \\ \hline
			Probability Mass & Probability Density \\ \hline		
			$P(X=x_i)\;\forall x_i\in\Omega$ & $P(X=x)=\int_x^{x+dx}f(x)dx$ \\ \hline
			$P(x_i) \geq 0;\;\forall i$ & $f(x) \geq 0;\;-\infty < x < \infty$\\ \hline
			$\sum_{i=0}^{n} P_i = 1$ & $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$\\ \hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Cumulative Distribution} \\ \hline
			$F(x_i) = P(X<x_i) = \sum_{x<x_i} P(x)$ & $F(x) = P(X<a) = \int_{-\infty}^{a} f(x) dx$ \\ \hline

\begin{frame}{Characterizing a Random Variable}
	If we know the distribution of a random variable, we pretty much know all is needed about it. 
	\newline

		\includegraphics[height=3 cm]{real_data}
	\end{columns}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        
	But with \textit{real data}, we don't know the full distribution. Fortunately we can characterize it by a couple of numbers (\emph{statistics}).
	\pause
	\small{
		\begin{center}
			\textcolor{red}{mean:} $\boxed{\mu = \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xf(x)dx}$\quad
			\textcolor{red}{variance:}  
			$\boxed{\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2] =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-\mu)^2f(x)dx}$
	\end{center}
}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Expectation and Its Properties}
\begin{frame}{Properties of Expectation}
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
	{\tiny {\tiny }}{
		\begin{table}[bt]
			\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
				Scalar multiplication & $\mathbb{E}[aX] = a\mathbb{E}[X]$ \\ \hline
				Sums & $\mathbb{E}[X_1+\ldots +X_K] =  \mathbb{E}[X_1] +\ldots + \mathbb{E}[X_n]$ \\ \hline
				Linear combinations & $\mathbb{E}[a_1X_1+\ldots +a_KX_K] =  a_1\mathbb{E}[X_1] +\ldots + a_K\mathbb{E}[X_K]$ \\ \hline
				Expected value of a constant & $\mathbb{E}[a] = a$ \\ \hline
				Products (independent variables) & $\mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X] \mathbb{E}[Y]$ \\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}
	}
	Essentially all the expectation properties come from integration properties, e.g.
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbb{E}[aX] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} ax f(x) dx = a  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx = a\mathbb{E}[X]
	\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

\section{Stochastic Processes}
\begin{frame}{Stochastic Process}
	Real world data is noisy (i.e. distorted), and exhibits behaviours that cannot be described by a deterministic model (always produce same result from same inputs, e.g $f(x)=x^3+2$).
	\pause
	\begin{tabular}{cl}  
		\begin{tabular}{c}
			\includegraphics[height=3cm]{stochastic_process}

				Need to switch to \textcolor{red}{stochastic processes} in order to model the uncertainty of data.  
			}
		\end{tabular}  \\
	\end{tabular}
    \pause
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		A collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set (usually time) is called a \textcolor{red}{stochastic processes}.
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{SDE}
\begin{frame}{Stochastic Differential Equation}
	
	Stochastic processes are described by \emph{stochastic differential equations} (SDE):
	
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			dX(t) = \mu(t,X(t)) dt &+ \sigma(t,X(t)) dW(t) =\\  & =\underbrace{\mu(t,X(t))dt}_{\textrm{deterministic}} + \underbrace{\sigma(t,X(t)) \mathcal{N}(0,1)\sqrt{dt}}_{\textrm{stochastic}}
		\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:sde}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{tabular}{cl}  
		\begin{tabular}{c}
			\includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{brownian_process}
		\end{tabular}
		& \begin{tabular}{l}
			\parbox{0.45\linewidth}{
				\begin{itemize}
					% FIXME CONTROLLARE
					\item $W(t)$ is called a \emph{Wiener Process}, is normally distributed and independent of everything has happened up to time $t$;
					\item for $s< t$ the stochastic variable $W(t)-W(s)$ has a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, t)$, i.e. the standard deviation grows with the square root of time.
				\end{itemize}  
			}
		\end{tabular}  \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Wiener Process}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Using simple properties of the normal distribution we can obtain the following results:
			\begin{equation*}
				\begin{gathered}
					\mathbb{E}[\Delta W] = 0 \\
					\mathbb{E}[(\Delta W)^2] = \Delta t \\
					\text{Var}[\Delta W] = \Delta t \\
					\text{Var}[(\Delta W)^2] = 2(\Delta t)^2 \\
				\end{gathered}
			\end{equation*}
		\item The striking fact is that as $\Delta t$ tends to 0, $[(\Delta W)^2]$ goes to 0, but its variance will approach 0 much faster.
		\item Thus, heuristically, we can say that $[(\Delta W)^2]$ looks more and more "deterministic" and in the limit we can naively say:
		\begin{equation*}
		\boxed{dW^2 = dt}
		\end{equation*}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Stochastic Integral}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is possible to interpret~\cref{eq:sde} as a shorthand for 
			\begin{equation*}
				X(t) = X(0) + \int_0^t \mu(s,X(s)) ds + \int_0^t \sigma(s,X(s)) dW(s)
			\end{equation*}
		where the last term is the so-called \emph{It$\hat{o}$'s integral}.
		\item Without entering into the details of stochastic calculus we can state the two most important properties of an It$\hat{o}$ integral:
			\begin{equation*}
				\begin{gathered}
					\mathbb{E}\left[\int_a^b g(s) dW(s)\right] = 0 \\
					\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\int_a^b g(s) dW(s)\right)^2\right] = \int_a^b\mathbb{E}[g^2(s)]ds\\
				\end{gathered}
			\end{equation*}
	\end{itemize}  
\end{frame}

\subsection{Martingales}
\begin{frame}{Filtration}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		With the symbol $\mathcal{F}^X_t$ it is indicated a \textbf{filtration}. It represents the information generated by $X$ on the interval $[0, t]$, i.e. what has happened to $X$ over the interval. 
	\end{block}
	\begin{itemize}	
		\item If the value of a stochastic variable $X$ ca be completely determined given observations of its trajectories $\{X(s); 0\leq s \leq t\}$, then we can write $X\in\mathcal{F}_t^X$ and $X$ is said to be $\mathcal{F}_t^X$\emph{-measurable}.
		\item If $Y$ is a stochastic process such that $Y(t)\in\mathcal{F}_t^X$ for all $t$ then we say that $Y$ is \emph{adapted} to the filtration $\mathcal{F}_t^X$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conditional Expectation}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		Given the information (filtration) $\mathcal{F}_t$, for any stochastic variable $X$ consider
		\begin{equation*}
			\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}_t]
		\end{equation*}
		which represents the \textbf{conditional expectation} of $X$.
		By definition it also holds that $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}}X] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}]]$.
	\end{block}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Given $X$ and $Y$ stochastic variables with $Y$ $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable:
		\begin{equation*}
			\mathbb{E}[Y\cdot X|\mathcal{F}_t] =  Y\cdot\mathbb[X|\mathcal{F}_t]
		\end{equation*}
		indeed if $Y\in\mathcal{F}_t$ we know exactly its value, so in the expectation it can be treated as a constant and taken outside.
		\item If $X$ is a stochastic variable and $s<t$ (\emph{law of iterated expectations}):
		\begin{equation*}
			\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}_t]|\mathcal{F}_s] = \mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}_s]
		\end{equation*}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Martingale}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		A \textcolor{red}{$\mathcal{F}_t$-martingale} is a (integrable and adapted) stochastic process which models a fair game with the following remarkable feature
		\begin{equation}
			\mathbb{E}[X_t|\mathcal{F}_s] = X_s
		\end{equation}
		so the best prediction for the future value $X_t$, given the knowledge $\mathcal{F}_s$ at time $s$ is the value at time $s$ itself, $X_s$.
	\end{block}
%	\begin{block}{Properties}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If $X_t$ is a stochastic process with diffusion coefficient $\sigma_t$, such that %which satisfies $\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\int_0^T\sigma^2_s ds\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]<\infty$, and SDE 
	$dX_t=\mu_t dt+\sigma_t dW_t$, then 
	\begin{equation*}
		X\text{ is a martingale } \iff X\text{ is drift-less } (\mu_t=0)
	\end{equation*}
	\item A martingale corresponds to the common notion that "an efficient price, changes randomly" so we cannot know if it will go up or down. That is why this mathematical concept is brought into finance.

\subsection{Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)}
\begin{frame}{Geometric Brownian Motion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<0-> Trade random fluctuations deviate a stock price $S_t$ from a steady state.
		\item<0-> The price relative change in $dt$ can be decomposed into two parts
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<2-> \textcolor{red}{deterministic}: the expected return from holding the stock during $dt$. It can be expressed as $\mu S_tdt$ (with $\mu$ being the expected rate of return);
			\item<3-> \textcolor{red}{stochastic}: models the random changes of the market. A reasonable assumption is to equal this term to $\sigma S_t dW_t$. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item<4-> Putting all together, the resulting SDE is
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{gathered}
				dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t \\
				\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = d\log(S_t) = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t

\subsubsection{It$\hat{o}$'s Formula}
\begin{frame}{It$\hat{o}$'s Formula}
	\begin{block}{Proposition}
		For any given continuous and differentiable function $G(S,t)$ where S satisfies $dS=adt + bdW_t$, holds
		\begin{equation}
			dG = \left(a\frac{\partial G}{\partial S} + \frac{\partial G}{\partial t} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}b^2\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial S^2}}_{\text{additional term}}\right)dt + b\frac{\partial G}{\partial S} dW
			\label{Eq:itos_lemma}
		\end{equation}

	This is essentially an extension of the \emph{Taylor series} for stochastic functions, in the expansion an extra term appears.	
	\end{block}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{It$\hat{o}$'s Formula "Proof"}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Suppose $X_t$ is an stochastic process that satisfies the SDE
	\begin{equation*}	
	dX_{t}=\mu _{t}\,dt+\sigma _{t}\,dW_{t}
	\end{equation*}.
	\item If $f(t,x)$ is a twice-differentiable scalar function of $x$, its expansion in a Taylor series is
	\begin{equation*}
	df={\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\,dt+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial t^{2}}}\,dt^{2}+\cdots +{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}\,dx+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}\,dx^{2}+\cdots
	\end{equation*}
	\item Substituting $X_t$ for $x$ and $dX_t$ with the SDE gives
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		df&={\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\,dt+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial t^{2}}}\,dt^{2}+\cdots +{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(\mu _{t}\,dt+\sigma _{t}\,dW_{t})+\\
		&+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}\left(\mu _{t}^{2}\,dt^{2}+2\mu _{t}\sigma _{t}\,dt\,dW_{t}+\sigma _{t}^{2}\,dW_{t}^{2}\right)+\cdots
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{It$\hat{o}$'s Formula "Proof"}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Stopping the expansion up to the first order (i.e. neglecting higher order terms in $dt^2$ and in $dt dW_t$), collecting $dt$ and $dW$ terms, and remembering that $dW^2=dt$, we obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
			df&={\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\,dt+\cancel{{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial t^{2}}}\,dt^{2}}+\cdots +{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(\mu _{t}\,dt+\sigma _{t}\,dW_{t})+\\

			&=\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}+\mu _{t}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\sigma _{t}^{2}}{2}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}\right)dt+\sigma _{t}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}\,dW_{t}
		\end{aligned}

	as required.

\subsubsection{Log-normality}
\begin{frame}{Log-normality}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The variation in $\log(S_t)$ equals a constant (the \emph{drift} $\mu-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2$) plus a Gaussian distributed random variable. Therefore at some time $t$
		\begin{equation*}
			\log S_t = \mathcal{N}\left[\left(\mu -\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t, \sigma^2 t\right]
		\end{equation*}
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		A random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed is said to be \textcolor{red}{log-normal}.

\begin{frame}{Final Remark on Stochastic Processes}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{sde_simulations}

When you have to get something out of a stochastic process you cannot rely on a single realization. 
Instead you need to take into account "all" the possible paths the process can go through in a \emph{statistical} way with an \textcolor{red}{expectation ($\mathbb{E}$)}. 
Hence it is mandatory to know (or assume) the \textcolor{red}{proper probability distribution}.

Fortunately it’s not just me who thinks it’s all overly complicated but even Paul Wilmott \href{https://wilmott.com/science-in-finance-viii-the-maths-sweet-spot/}{thinks the profession takes it just a bit too far} and he’s a bit better at maths than me.\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{frame}{Portfolio}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		A \textcolor{red}{portfolio} is a vector $\mathbf{\theta}\in \mathbb{R}^K$ whose $j$ components represent the number of shares of asset $A_j$ (asset $A_0$ is risk-free). It's value is
		\begin{equation}
			V_t(\mathbf{\theta}, \omega)=\sum_{j=1}^K\theta_jS^j_t(\omega)
		\end{equation} 
		where $S_t^j$ is the value of $j$-th asset, and $\omega$ a market situation. A portfolio is \textcolor{red}{self-financing} if its value changes only due to variations of the asset prices.

\begin{frame}{Arbitrage}
	\begin{block}{Definition}
		An \textcolor{red}{arbitrage} is a self financing portfolio $\mathbf{\theta}$ such that
		\begin{equation}

		P(V_{t}\geq 0)=1{\text{ and }}P(V_{t}\neq 0)>0,\,0<t\leq T
		\end{equation}
		where $V_0=0$, $V_t$ denotes the portfolio value at time $t$ and $T$ is the time the portfolio ceases to be available on the market. This means that the value of the portfolio is never negative, and guaranteed to be positive at least once over its lifetime.

\begin{frame}{Arbitrage}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	Informally, \textcolor{red}{arbitrage is a way to make a guaranteed profit from nothing}, by short-selling certain assets at time $t = 0$, using the proceeds to buy other assets, and then settling accounts at time $t$. 
		\item Arbitrage may take place when: the same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets, or two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price
		\item We are going to assuming the market doesn't allow for risk-free profits with no initial investment.
		Indeed arbitrage opportunities rarely exist in practice. If and when they do, gains are extremely small (not for small investors), and are typically short-lived and difficult to spot.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Prices of assets depend crucially on their risk as investors typically demand more profit for bearing more risk.
		\item<2-> Therefore, today's price of a claim on a risky amount realized tomorrow will generally differ from its expected value.
		\item<2-> Most commonly, investors are risk-averse and today's price is below the expectation, remunerating those who bear the risk.
		\item<4-> Consequently to price assets, the calculated expected values need to be adjusted for an investor's risk preferences
		\item<5-> Unfortunately, these adjustments would vary between investors and an individual's risk preference is very difficult to quantify.

	\begin{block}{Theorem I}
		There exists a \emph{risk-neutral measure} if and only \textcolor{red}{if arbitrages do not exist}.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	Proof:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{no-arbitrage$\rightarrow$risk-neutral measure}: requiring the model to be arbitrage-free sets conditions on $u, d$ and $e^r$ such that $p_u$ and $p_d$ define a probability measure (risk-neutral measure).
	\item \textbf{risk-neutral measure$\rightarrow$no-arbitrage}: consider an arbitrary portfolio such that 
	\begin{equation*}
		V_0 = xB_0 + yS_0 = 0
	\end{equation*}
	This yields $x = -yS_0$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fundamental Theorems of Arbitrage Pricing}
	Proof continued:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At $t=1$ we have 
		\begin{equation*}
			V_1 = xB_1 + yS_1 = -yS_0e^e + yS_0Z = yS_0(Z - e^r)\quad\text{with $Z$=\{u, d\}}
		\end{equation*}
		If $y > 0$ then $V_1\geq 0$ if $u - e^r \geq 0$ and $d - e^r \geq 0$
		which can not happen according to the assumption. Thus, if $y > 0$ \emph{the portfolio is not an arbitrage one}. 
		\item The case $y < 0$ is treated in the same way.

Implied from observable prices of tradable instruments, and used to determine \textcolor{red}{objective fair prices} for an asset or financial instrument. Probabilities are assessed with the risk taken out of the equation, so it doesn’t play a factor in the anticipated outcome.

By contrast, if you tried to estimate the anticipated value of a stock based on how likely it is to go up or down, considering unique factors or market conditions that influence that specific asset, you would be including risk into the equation and, thus, would be looking at \textcolor{red}{real or physical probability}.

		Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an arbitrage-free market with a risk-less asset. If for every derivative there is a replicating portfolio %in the assets $A_j$ 
		then the market $\mathcal{M}$ is complete. Conversely, if the market $\mathcal{M}$ is complete, and if the unique risk-neutral measure $\mathcal{Q}$ gives positive probability to every market scenario $\omega$, then for every derivative security there is a replicating portfolio in the assets $A_j$.
	\end{block}

		\item Fix and arbitrary claim $X$ with contract function $\Phi$ and a portfolio such that
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{cases}
				V_1 = x e^r + yS_0u = \Phi(u)\\
				V_1 = x e^r + yS_0d = \Phi(d)
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation*}
		\item Since our model assume $d<u$ there exists a \textbf{unique} solution
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
				x &= e^{-r}\cfrac{u\Phi(d)-d\Phi(d)}{u-d} \\
				y &= \cfrac{1}{S_0}\cfrac{\Phi(u)-\Phi(d)}{u-d}

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Risk-Neutral Measure and Pricing}
	
	Under the conditions which makes our model arbitrage-free, there exists a martingale (risk-neutral) measure and the free arbitrage price of a contingent claim $X$ is given by 
	\begin{equation*}
		\Pi(0; X) = e^{-r}\mathbb{E}^{\mathcal{Q}}[X]
	\end{equation*} 
	The martingale measure $\mathcal{Q}$ is uniquely identified by \cref{}.
	\begin{block}{Proposition}
		Assume there exists a \textcolor{red}{risk-neutral measure} $\mathcal{Q}^0$ %on the set $\Omega$ of possible market scenarios 
		and let $A$ be an asset. Then, for each time $t$, $0\le t\le T$ there exists a unique price $\pi_t$ associated with $A$
		\begin{equation}
			\pi_t = \mathbb{E}^{\mathcal{Q}^0}[D(t,T)V_A|\mathcal{F}_t]
			\label{eq:risk_neutral_pricing}
		\end{equation}
	\end{block}
	
	Indeed, the market is complete, so from the replicating portfolio we know that $\Pi(0;X) = V_0$ and using \cref{} we can explicitly calculate the price as
	\begin{equation*}
	\Pi(0;X) = e^{-r}\left[\cfrac{e^r-d}{u-d}\Phi(u)+\cfrac{u-e^r}{u-d}\Phi(d)\right]
	\end{equation*}
	which in turns becomes according to \cref{}
	\begin{equation*}
		\Pi(0;X) = e^{-r}\left[q_u\Phi(u)+q_d\Phi(d)\right]
	\end{equation*}
	the expected value, under the martingale measure.
	
	%Such a price is given by the expectation of the discounted payoff under the measure $\mathcal{Q}^0$.
	
	%Note that $\mathcal{F}_t$ is called \textcolor{red}{filtration} and represents our knowledge of the system up to time $t$, i.e. the expectation is indeed \emph{conditioned} to what happened until time $t$.
	%The benefit of this risk-neutral pricing approach is that once the risk-neutral probabilities are calculated, they can be used to price every asset based on its expected payoff. These theoretical risk-neutral probabilities differ from actual real-world probabilities, which are sometimes also referred to as physical probabilities. If real-world probabilities were used, the expected values of each security would need to be adjusted for its individual risk profile.
	
	%You might think of this approach as a structured method of guessing what the fair and proper price for a financial asset should be by tracking price trends for other similar assets and then estimating the average to arrive at your best guess. 
	
	%For this approach, you would try to level out the extreme fluctuations at either end of the spectrum, creating a balance that creates a stable, level price point. You would essentially be minimizing the possible unusual high market outcomes while increasing the possible lows.
